# services/backend — SPEC (the off-chain rail surface)

> Scope: this file owns ONLY the off-chain rail — the one Bun service and its
> modules. The global picture (the two primitives, the x402 V2 rail, custody,
> network) lives in the root `CLAUDE.md`; the subscription contract lives in
> `packages/move-subs/SPEC.md`. This file references those, never redeclares them.
> Each fact is stated once. **`account.move` / `RailConfig` / the old pull-relayer /
> `suize-402/1` / `X-Suize-Payment` / `/pay/build` / `/pay/submit` are DELETED** —
> the live rail is vanilla **x402 V2 'exact' over Sui's protocol-level gasless
> Address-Balance transfers** (the payer signs a `send_funds` PTB with its OWN key,
> `gasPayment=[]`, `gasPrice=0` — no gas token, ever).

The backend is **deterministic code, not an AI** — a facilitator + an executor + a
storage extender. It **NEVER signs an owner transaction**: every payment is a gasless
tx the **payer signs locally with its own key**; the facilitator only verifies and
broadcasts (keyless). The backend's only keys are the **Enoki sponsor** (pays gas for
the few sponsored surfaces — Crash bets, the wallet's subscription Party-object
writes) and its service wallets (deploy / handle issuer) — see "The number wall,"
below. **The facilitator settles KEYLESS — it holds no signing key for a payment.**

One Bun service, one port, one image, one deploy. Every module is a route matcher
`(req, url, origin, server) => Promise<Response> | null`; the first non-null wins
(`src/index.ts`). All config is env-only via `src/config.ts` (mirrored by
`.env.example`); secrets are env vars, never hardcoded, never bundled.

## 0. Status at a glance (BUILT vs STUB — honest)

| Module | Status |
|---|---|
| **mcp** (`src/mcp`) | **BUILT, bare.** `POST /mcp`, hand-rolled JSON-RPC 2.0 Streamable-HTTP. One no-auth tool `suize_ping`. NO auth, NO payment, NO Sui, NO session. The real wallet tools (`suize_pay` / `suize_balance` / `suize_receipts` / …) live in the local `@suize/mcp` stdio package, not in this bare backend route. |
| **deploy** (`src/deploy`) | **BUILT + PROVEN end-to-end** (2026-06-10 — it shipped our own landing to Walrus testnet: auth nonce → tar → quilt + manifest → on-chain `Site` → hash-verified serving). `deploy_sui` is published on testnet (real ids in `@suize/shared`). Custom-domain link/unlink built. The **$0.50 x402 charge gate** (`src/deploy/payment.ts` — a first-party single-output x402 'exact' settlement verified + settled in-process, single-use digest reservation) is BUILT; it **arms the moment the Deploy treasury (`treasury@suize`) resolves** (no more `account` flags — `chargeGateReady()` = treasury resolves). Pays its own gas for the Site mint — NOT Enoki-sponsored. |
| **facilitator** (§7) | **BUILT + PROVEN — x402 V2 'exact', KEYLESS, E2E on REAL testnet.** `POST /verify` · `POST /settle` · `GET /supported` · `POST /build` · `GET /terms` · `GET /tx` live in `src/facilitator/` (`x402.ts` the verify/settle/build core, `fees.ts` the SuiNS-resolved treasury + the `extra.outputs` 2%/1¢ split, `index.ts` the HTTP layer). The **`@suize/pay` middleware shipped** (`packages/pay` — answers the x402 V2 `PaymentRequired` challenge; zero runtime deps, fetch-style + Express adapters), built on **`@suize/x402`** (the gasless `send_funds` builder + `assertOutputsExact` + `recoverPayer` + the gasless-shape guard). KEYLESS + STATELESS — the chain is the database; the payer signs the gasless tx with its OWN key, the facilitator only verifies (simulate) + broadcasts (gRPC, idempotent by digest). The agent pays by signing the gasless USDC payment ITSELF and presenting `X-PAYMENT` — either with its own Sui key or its zkLogin session via `@suize/mcp`; there is no hosted pay page and no human-pays relay. |
| **sponsor** (`src/sponsor`) | **BUILT.** `createSponsor` / `executeSponsor` (+ `sponsorKindBytes`) over Enoki, with the move-call allow-list + gas-drain ceilings. **Allow-list (`src/sponsor/index.ts`):** `[...CRASH_MOVE_TARGETS, ...(SUBS_PUBLISHED ? SUBS_MOVE_TARGETS : []), ...(AUCTION_PUBLISHED ? AUCTION_MOVE_TARGETS : []), ...MEMWAL_MOVE_TARGETS]` — Crash `router::*`, the standalone `subs::subscription` create/renew/cancel, the directory's `auction::bid` (each plus the gasless `redeem_funds`/`into_balance` helpers the Balance push needs), and the **MemWal** wallet-memory onboarding (`<memwalPkg>::account::create_account` + `add_delegate_key` — a NON-money delegate key, env-gated on `MEMWAL_PACKAGE_ID`). **`WALLET_MOVE_TARGETS` was REMOVED 2026-06-14** (move-wallet retired-in-place, in no live path) and **`account.move` is DEAD** — neither is in the allow-list. Sponsors the few non-gasless surfaces only (a vanilla x402 `send_funds` needs no sponsor). |
| **directory** (§7.8, `src/directory`) | **BUILT** (2026-06-14). The off-chain surface for `agents.suize.io` (`apps/agents/SPEC.md`): `/feed` `/rankings` `/stats` `/ads/slots` `/ads/slots/:key` `/directory.json` `/directory.okf`. Merchant-agnostic — reads EVERY x402 payment LIVE from chain via the treasury fee-leg (read-through cached); stores no payment state. Curl-proven on testnet; not yet deployed to `api.suize.io` (k8s). |
| **handle** (`src/handle`) | **BUILT.** Fully on-chain SuiNS leaf-subname issuance (`<name>@suize`). Optional — 503 when SuiNS env unset. *Not load-bearing for the rail; the rail has no SuiNS dependency for payments (the treasury fee-recipient IS resolved from a SuiNS name — §7.5).* |
| **storage extender** (§5, `src/deploy/extend.ts`) | **BUILT, env-gated, wired at boot.** Replaces the deleted pull-relayer. It does NOT charge (the push-not-pull `subs` module already did) — its ONLY job is to keep a PAID Deploy site's Walrus storage extended in place: an **on-settle hook** (`notifySettled`, fired from the sponsor execute path) + a **6h safety cron** (`startStorageCron`), each extending the site's two blobs (`system::extend_blob`, ≤50-epoch clamp), with an F5 owner-binding so a crafted `ref` can't drain the service WAL. See §5. |
| **agent** (`src/agent`) | **STUB.** No-op. Reminder: the real backend is the facilitator + executor + storage extender, NOT an AI agent. Do not wire an inference loop here. |
| **transport** (`src/ws`) | **BUILT, LIVE + load-bearing.** Sponsor + handle run over the one Enoki-verified WebSocket (auth ONCE at connect via a signed personal-message nonce; `ws.data.address` is the session identity). The old "HTTP-only, delete `src/ws`" plan was **repudiated** — root `CLAUDE.md` LOCKED #14 (corrected 2026-06-10): two transports, one auth primitive (§6). |
| **readiness** | **BUILT.** `/health`, `/ready`, `/ready/{sponsor,handle,deploy,ws,serve}` — per-component, an unconfigured/down dep never 503s an unrelated surface. |

## 1. The rail, off-chain (x402 V2 'exact' — how a payment is reached)

The rail is **vanilla x402 V2 'exact' over Sui's protocol-level gasless Address-Balance
transfers** (the global picture is in root `CLAUDE.md`). A payment is a single tx the
**payer signs with its OWN key** — a `send_funds` PTB with `gasPayment=[]` and
`gasPrice=0` (no gas token), whose declared outputs ARE the settlement (and, for an
onboarded merchant, the 2%/1¢ fee split). The facilitator (§7) verifies that
signed-but-not-executed tx pays the EXACT declared outputs (simulate), then settles by
broadcasting it (gRPC) — **keyless**: no Enoki, no sponsor, no owner-tx signing. The
fee is **merchant-absorbed** and lives in `extra.outputs` (a second declared output to
the treasury) — the payer always pays exactly the listed price. **NO free tier** (owner
law 2026-06-14): EVERY merchant pays (unregistered → the default 2%); the only
single-output result is structural (merchant == treasury, or a sub-unit amount). The doors, one rail:

1. **The consumer PAY wallet app** (the PRIMARY payer surface, root `CLAUDE.md` LOCKED
   #6) — pays from the user's own balance, custody law intact: the in-app zkLogin session
   **signs the gasless payment locally** per the confirm dial. Recurring spend rides the
   standalone **`subs::subscription`** module (push-not-pull: the user signs each
   renewal; the wallet renews silently when open — `apps/wallet/SPEC.md`).
2. **The local MCP** *(the developer / power-user door — CHARGE-side ONLY, DEPRECATED as
   the consumer path)* — an external assistant's (Claude/Codex) Suize MCP runs the local
   x402-client flow via its `suize_pay` tool (read the challenge → build the gasless
   payment → sign locally → settle via the facilitator) (§3, §7).
3. **The facilitator HTTP doors** (§7 — BUILT + E2E-proven) — any external agent: the
   **FACILITATOR door** (`POST /build` returns the unsigned gasless bytes → the agent
   signs with its own key → `POST /settle`), and the **POWER door** (a Sui-native agent
   builds its own `send_funds` PTB, signs, and hands the b64 `PaymentPayload` in the
   **`X-PAYMENT`** header on retry). Two doors, one wire: the agent ALWAYS signs the
   gasless payment itself — there is no human-pays / pay-link path.
4. **`llms.txt`** — a static discovery door (content LAW in root `CLAUDE.md`). The
   rail contract is LIVE at `suize.io/llms.txt` — the hub every per-product llms.txt
   links back to (deploy/crash/wallet ship their own).

A **merchant** integrates by dropping the `@suize/pay` middleware (§7.4): answer HTTP
**402** with the x402 V2 `PaymentRequired` challenge, then verify the retry's `X-PAYMENT`
payload through the facilitator's `POST /verify` + `POST /settle` — zero wallet/chain
code merchant-side, no KYB, live in minutes. **The facilitator is STATELESS + KEYLESS —
the chain is the database; the payer signs, Suize verifies + broadcasts.** Protocol = the
**x402 V2 Sui 'exact' scheme** (§7); the claim ladder (root `CLAUDE.md`) governs the
public wording — never "on x402" until the upstream mechanism PR MERGES.

---

## 2. sponsor — Enoki sponsored transactions (BUILT, core)

`src/sponsor/index.ts`. The transport-agnostic core: `createSponsor(input)` →
`{ bytes, digest }`, `executeSponsor({ digest, signature })` → `{ digest }`. The user
signs `bytes` with their **local** zkLogin session; the backend never holds that key.

**The allow-list is the gas-drain guard.** Enoki refuses to sponsor any move call
outside `ALLOWED_MOVE_TARGETS`. The lists are the single source of truth in
`@suize/shared`:

- `CRASH_MOVE_TARGETS` — the live `…::router::*` Crash targets (testnet).
- `SUBS_MOVE_TARGETS` — the standalone **`subs::subscription`** create/renew/cancel,
  plus the gasless `redeem_funds`/`into_balance` helpers the per-period Balance push
  needs (`packages/move-subs/SPEC.md`).
- `AUCTION_MOVE_TARGETS` — the directory's **`auction::bid`** (`packages/move-auction/SPEC.md`)
  + the same gasless `redeem_funds`/`into_balance` helpers. User-signed + Enoki-sponsored,
  the same shape as a subs renewal; unioned in only once published.
- `MEMWAL_MOVE_TARGETS` — the **MemWal** wallet-memory onboarding
  (`<memwalPkg>::account::create_account` + `add_delegate_key`): the user signs ONE
  sponsored tx authorizing the backend's derived MEMORY delegate key (explicitly a
  NON-money key — `src/memory`). Env-gated on `MEMWAL_PACKAGE_ID` (unset → empty).

The effective allow-list (`src/sponsor/index.ts`) is
`[...CRASH_MOVE_TARGETS, ...(SUBS_PUBLISHED ? SUBS_MOVE_TARGETS : []), ...(AUCTION_PUBLISHED ? AUCTION_MOVE_TARGETS : []), ...MEMWAL_MOVE_TARGETS]`.
**`WALLET_MOVE_TARGETS` (the legacy mandate/vault/swap/navi package) was REMOVED 2026-06-14**
(retired-in-place, called by no first-party code — a Move-audit fix).
**`account.move` is DEAD — there is no `ACCOUNT_MOVE_TARGETS` and no `RailConfig`.** The
sponsor exists ONLY for the surfaces that genuinely need gas: Crash bets and the wallet's
subscription Party-object writes (a Party-object mint is not fully gas-rebatable). A
vanilla x402 payment is a gasless `send_funds` — it needs **no sponsor at all** (the
protocol rebates it), which is why the facilitator (§7) is keyless.

**Hardening (keep):**
- `sender` is pinned to the verified caller identity, NEVER a body field;
  `allowedAddresses = [sender]` so a sponsored tx cannot redirect funds to a third party.
- Network hard-rejected unless `testnet` (the v1 mainnet flip changes this guard — see
  the root `CLAUDE.md` mainnet gate).
- Oversized-PTB reject (`MAX_TX_KIND_BYTES = 16 KiB`) before Enoki sees it — caps the
  sponsored gas budget against an inflate-the-budget drain.
- **Gas-drain ceilings** (`src/quota.ts`): a process-global daily cap + a per-address
  sub-cap, consumed AFTER validation and BEFORE the Enoki call (a rejected request
  never burns budget). In-memory, per-replica — Enoki's own pool budget is the hard cap.
- Enoki failure detail (Move aborts, allow-list shape, dry-run internals) is logged
  **server-side only**; the client gets a category-only message — no information
  disclosure.

**Relation to the facilitator (§7):** NONE on the payment path — the facilitator is
**keyless** and uses the gRPC client, NOT this Enoki sponsor. A vanilla x402 `send_funds`
is gasless at the protocol level, so the FACILITATOR door (`POST /build` → sign →
`POST /settle`) never touches `createSponsor`. The sponsor's only payment-adjacent
caller is the wallet's `/confirm-subscribe` Party-object write (sponsored because that
mint isn't gas-rebatable — `apps/wallet/SPEC.md` §6b). One sponsor core; the facilitator
is a separate keyless settlement spine.

`sponsorReady()` probes Sui RPC reachability for `/ready/sponsor`.

---

## 3. mcp — the remote-MCP transport (BUILT bare; the pay/deploy tools to build)

`src/mcp/index.ts`. `POST /mcp`, hand-rolled JSON-RPC 2.0 Streamable-HTTP
(`initialize` / `notifications/initialized` / `ping` / `tools/list` / `tools/call`),
single-shot `application/json` responses (no SSE channel, no sessions). Hand-rolled,
not the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` — the SDK's Node-stream transport fights this
service's `Request→Response` matcher chain for zero benefit at one tool. Body capped at
64 KiB; batch supported; notifications → 202.

**BUILT:** one tool, `suize_ping` — a no-auth liveness greeting. No auth, no payment,
no Sui, no state.

> Post-pivot scope note (root `CLAUDE.md` LOCKED #6): the MCP is an **optional
> developer / CHARGE-side integration** — never how a consumer uses PAY (that is the
> self-contained wallet app). The tools below remain worth building for external/dev
> agents paying merchants.

**TO BUILD — the real tools (the dev/power-user door, owner-validated 2026-06-10):**

One-line install: `claude mcp add suize -- npx -y @suize/mcp`, then Google zkLogin once
(§3.2). LAW (root `CLAUDE.md`, the integration surface): every product surface carries
a **"Use with Claude/Codex"** doc section.

- **`suize_pay`** — the x402 client. Given a merchant's x402 V2 `PaymentRequired`
  challenge (or a pay-link/amount): read the declared outputs, **check the confirm-policy
  dial** (§3.1), build the gasless `send_funds` payment (or `POST /build`), **sign with
  the LOCAL zkLogin session**, settle **via the facilitator** (§7: `POST /settle`). Zero
  payment code for the agent author. The receipt (the on-chain balance-change set, fee
  visible) returned as tool output.
- **`suize_balance`** — the agent address's USDC balance (= the hard cap — the MCP's own
  zkLogin address), read direct-to-chain.
- **`suize_receipts`** — the caller's settled payments (fee visible in the
  balance-changes), read direct-to-chain.
- **`suize_subscriptions`** — the caller's on-chain subscriptions (merchant, amount,
  period, paid-until, active), read direct-to-chain.
- **`suize_kill`** — sweep the agent address's ENTIRE balance back to the paired main
  wallet (gasless) and clear the local session. Idempotent; an empty wallet is a no-op.

> The MCP is a **wallet** — pay, read, kill (6 tools incl. `authenticate`). Deploy is
> NOT an MCP tool: Suize Deploy is a plain x402 endpoint an agent calls directly
> (`apps/deploy/SPEC.md` / its `llms.txt`), so the wallet MCP stays merchant-agnostic.

All tools **sign locally** — the facilitator verifies + broadcasts, never signs. Auth
into the MCP = Google (local zkLogin, via the wallet-origin `/agent-connect` door under
a SECOND distinct client id — `apps/wallet/SPEC.md` §6b); there is NO remote OAuth broker
and NO `set_agent`.

### 3.1 Confirm-policy dials (client-side, in the MCP — NOT a backend gate)

The spending leash has two layers: on-chain physics (the agent ADDRESS's own balance =
hard cap; kill = stop funding + revoke at the source; a subscription = a push-not-pull
Party object the user signs each period) — and the **client-side policy dials** the MCP
enforces before signing: `confirm-each` (default — co-pilot), `auto-under-$X`,
`full-auto`, `confirm-new-subscription`. **Subscriptions, once approved, renew silently**
(exempt from the dial — keeps the Deploy renewal alive). These dials live in the
MCP/Wallet, never on-chain; they gate whether the local session signs, nothing more.
Marketing: *"autonomy you switch on."*

### 3.2 MCP auth & local zkLogin signing (VERIFIED 2026-06-08 vs Enoki + Mysten docs)

The non-custodial guarantee, concretely. The signer is a zkLogin **ephemeral**
`Ed25519Keypair` the MCP **generates and holds locally** — it is the only thing that can
sign, and it never leaves the machine. (Reference: Mysten's own
`sui keytool zk-login-sign-and-execute-tx` is this exact headless flow.)

**First-time auth (once per session ≈ 48 h):**
1. `ephemeral = new Ed25519Keypair()` — local (in-mem or encrypted in `~/.suize/`). **Only signer; never leaves.**
2. Nonce for `maxEpoch = currentEpoch + 2` (Enoki `POST /v1/zklogin/nonce`, or local `generateNonce`).
3. **Browser hand-off:** open the Google OAuth URL carrying that nonce; capture the `id_token` via a **loopback callback** (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>`) — or manual paste (keytool-style) for v1.
4. Salt + address: Enoki `GET /v1/zklogin` (`zklogin-jwt: <id_token>`) — see the salt note.
5. Proof: Enoki `POST /v1/zklogin/zkp` (`zklogin-jwt` + ephemeral pubkey + maxEpoch + randomness) → cache the partial proof for the session.

**Per-tx signing (fully local until `maxEpoch`):** build the sponsored tx →
`userSignature = ephemeral.signTransaction(bytes)` (**local**) →
`getZkLoginSignature({ inputs: {…proof, addressSeed}, maxEpoch, userSignature })` →
execute via the Enoki sponsor.

**Stack:** `@mysten/sui/zklogin` (the standalone `@mysten/zklogin` is **DEPRECATED**) +
`EnokiClient` (Node, API-key, no browser). Enoki is **prover + sponsor + (optionally)
salt** only — it **cannot sign**: a valid signature needs (a) a fresh Google `id_token`
bound to the ephemeral key by nonce, (b) the salt, AND (c) the local ephemeral key. No
single party holds all three; the secret Enoki key alone cannot mint a proof (the prover
requires the user's live JWT). **Non-custodial: VALIDATED.**

**Salt — the one honesty footnote:** Enoki holds the salt by default (can derive the
address, still **cannot sign**). For an airtight *"keys never leave your machine,"*
**self-manage the salt** (deterministic from a local secret / stored locally) so Enoki
never holds it — **DECISION: self-manage** (matches calibrated honesty). If we ever use
Enoki's salt, copy must say "Enoki holds salt but cannot sign," never imply otherwise.

**Mainnet:** Enoki proving + sponsoring on mainnet need a paid tier (≥ $69/mo); testnet
is free; the prover is self-hostable (Docker) to drop the Enoki dependency.
**ANTI-PATTERN (do not copy):** `tamago-labs/sui-butler`'s zkLogin mode pushes txs to a
server and signs server-side — the opposite of our model.

### 3.3 The external (non-MCP) payer — the POWER door: build the gasless tx, the facilitator settles

An agent on **any** Sui key (a competitor's wallet, a raw keypair) pays a Suize merchant
with **no Suize account and no MCP**: the merchant's x402 V2 challenge names the
settlement = a gasless `send_funds` paying the declared `extra.outputs` (the merchant net
+ the treasury fee leg) — both sides are plain ADDRESSES. The agent builds that gasless
PTB itself (or `POST /build`), **signs with its own key**, and hands the b64
`PaymentPayload` back in the **`X-PAYMENT`** header on retry (§7). The facilitator
**verifies (simulate) + settles (broadcast)** — it holds no key and stores nothing per
payment; the on-chain balance-change set IS the receipt, fee visible. The fee can't be
routed around: a single-output payment to a fee-tier merchant fails the facilitator's
exact-outputs check (`assertOutputsExact`) → not settled. The claim ladder (root
`CLAUDE.md`) governs the public wording.

## 4. deploy — the first merchant on the rail (BUILT; treasury-gated)

`src/deploy/index.ts`. The Deploy merchant orchestration. Detail + the billing model
(each deploy = a one-off $0.50 x402 settlement; the $19.99/mo push-not-pull `subs`
subscription unlocks custom domains + auto-renewed Walrus storage) lives in
`apps/deploy/SPEC.md` — not redeclared here. What this service owns:

- `POST /deploy` (multipart `name`, `site.tar` + the `X-PAYMENT` header) — **authenticated
  BY THE PAYMENT ITSELF**, no anonymous deploy, **NO separate deploy-auth nonce/signature**
  (nonce-free since 2026-06-14). The X-PAYMENT carries a signed gasless payment; the
  on-chain `owner` is the **recovered payer** (`recoverPayer` — zkLogin, Ed25519, OR a
  1-of-2 sub-account MultiSig), never a client field — **whoever pays, owns**. Flow:
  **verify** the payment pays the exact $0.50 → **settle the payment** (broadcast, keyless)
  → unpack tar (caps: 100 MiB, 2000 files) → Walrus quilt + manifest blob → mint a fresh
  immutable shared `Site` (signed by the deploy service wallet, pays its own gas) with the
  **settled payment digest recorded in the on-chain `SiteDigestRegistry`** → `{ siteId,
  subdomain: base36(siteId), url, version, digest }`. Settle BEFORE the Walrus upload so an
  unsettled payment never burns WAL. The agent ALWAYS signs its own gasless payment (its own
  Sui key, or its zkLogin session via `@suize/mcp`) — there is no human-authorizes / relay
  path.
- `GET /sites[?owner=]`, `GET /sites/:id` — read from `SiteCreated` events + the Site
  object.
- `POST /domains` (issue challenge / `?verify=1`), `DELETE /domains/:domain` —
  custom-domain link/unlink behind a two-record DNS gate (TXT ownership + CNAME routing)
  AND a cryptographic site-owner signature (`buildDeployLink/UnlinkAuthMessage`, op-bound,
  **stateless-timestamped** `{ ts, signature }` — recovered signer == `Site.owner`, `ts`
  within a freshness window; NO server-issued nonce store, multi-replica-safe). Optional
  Cloudflare-for-SaaS auto-SSL; manual-CNAME fallback otherwise.

**Gates:** 503 "deploy not configured" when `DEPLOY_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` is unset; 503
while on-chain ids are `0x0` placeholders (on testnet the `deploy_sui` ids are REAL —
published at `0xadcc8d…`). Per-IP token bucket + a global daily deploy ceiling (each
deploy spends real SUI).

**PROVEN end-to-end:** this module shipped our own landing — tar → Walrus quilt +
manifest → on-chain `create_site` → served hash-verified by the worker (Site
`0xc96dd162…47b9d0c`, 30 epochs, `*.suize.site`). The nonce-free agent-pays path is
proven on testnet: a fresh agent signs a gasless $0.50, submits it as X-PAYMENT, and the
`Site` mints with `owner == the recovered payer` (verified on-chain). The charge gate
arms the moment the Deploy treasury resolves.

> **URL DOMAIN — RESOLVED (L3, verified 2026-06-10).** Worker, backend
> (`config.deployBaseDomain`), and `@suize/shared` all standardize served-site URLs on
> `<base36(siteId)>.suize.site`.

**The CHARGE↔Deploy join — x402 V2 'exact', first-party, KEYLESS** (`src/deploy/payment.ts`):
the deploy is a one-off **$0.50 x402 settlement** gated BEFORE any Walrus upload. Deploy
is a **first-party merchant** — the merchant IS the Suize treasury — so the requirement
is a **SINGLE full-amount output** of the $0.50 to the treasury (no fee split; 100%
already lands on us). The treasury (the fee-recipient) is resolved from a **SuiNS name**
(`treasury@suize`) — rotating it is one on-chain record edit, no redeploy. The gate
(`chargeGateReady()`) is now a SINGLE async predicate — **the treasury resolves**; no
`ACCOUNT_PUBLISHED`/`RAIL_CONFIG_SET` flags (the rail has no `RailConfig`). Until the
treasury resolves, the route runs **un-gated** (auth + rate limits + the daily gas-drain
ceiling — abuse mitigation, not billing); the moment it resolves, the gate lights up with
zero code change.

> **x402 V2, KEYLESS, NONCE-FREE (`src/deploy/payment.ts`).** `POST /deploy` speaks the
> standard: (a) a payment-less POST answers **402 with the x402 V2 `PaymentRequired` body
> + the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header** (price discovery is public; a generic agent settles
> zero-shot) — minted **STATELESSLY** via `@suize/pay`'s `mintPaymentRequired`,
> facilitator/buildUrl pointed at this process's own origin; the 402's `error` carries the
> deploy rider *"whoever pays owns the site"*;
> (b) the paid retry carries the b64 `PaymentPayload` in the **`X-PAYMENT`** header — the
> SOLE authorization, no separate deploy-auth signature. `gateDeployPayment` decodes it,

> **recovers the payer** (→ the on-chain `owner`; whoever pays, owns), and runs `doVerify`

This join is Deploy being merchant AND facilitator in one process — **it IS a client of
the ONE verify/settle core** (`src/facilitator/x402.ts` `doVerify`/`doSettle`, the same
spine every external payment rides) and layers only the owner=payer rule + the on-chain
one-site-per-payment registry on top. One verification spine, no parallel verifier.

**Storage auto-renewal** is the separate recurring leg on the push-not-pull `subs`
module — the user signs a `subscription::create` with `ref` = the site id, and the
backend's storage extender (§5) keeps that site's Walrus storage extended on settle. The
backend never charges for renewal; the `subs` module already took the period's payment.

---

## 5. The storage extender (BUILT, env-gated — replaces the deleted pull-relayer)

**The old `charge_subscription`-pulling relayer is DELETED** (it deducted from a shared
`Account` without the owner signing — `account.move` is dead). Recurring spend is now
**push-not-pull** on the standalone `subs::subscription` module: the user signs each
renewal themselves (the wallet pushes it, gas-sponsored), so **the backend never charges
and never reaches into a user's funds.** What's left on the backend is purely the storage
side of Deploy billing — keep a PAID site's Walrus storage extended so it never lapses.

**BUILT (`src/deploy/extend.ts`) and WIRED at boot** (`startStorageCron()`; no-op until
the deploy wallet + the published `subs` + `deploy` ids arm `storageEnabled()`). It does
NOT charge — the `subs` module already took the period's payment. **TWO triggers, ONE
extend path:**

- **The on-settle hook (`notifySettled`)** — fired fire-and-forget from the sponsor
  execute path after a successful sponsored tx. It reads the tx's events; any
  `SubscriptionCreated`/`SubscriptionRenewed` whose `merchant` is the Deploy treasury and
  whose `ref` decodes to a site id → extend that site's two blobs in the same beat.
- **The safety cron (`startStorageCron`)** — every `config.extendTickMs` (default 6h),
  page Deploy-merchant `SubscriptionCreated` events, drop cancelled (deleted) + lapsed
  (`paid_until_ms < now`) subs, and extend any whose blobs end within
  `config.renewalSafetyEpochs`. A missed hook (restart, off-box renewal) is still
  repaired.

The extend itself is one **service-wallet** PTB (`system::extend_blob` on the site's two
Walrus Blob objects, ≤50-epoch clamp; the service wallet pays the **WAL**, never the
user) — a blob-level extend, **no re-upload, no new write fee**. **NON-CUSTODIAL: nothing
here is an owner tx.** **F5 owner-binding (security):** a sub's `ref` is attacker-
controlled (anyone can create a `Subscription` with `ref` = another deployer's site id),
so the extender refuses unless the sub event's `owner` (== `ctx.sender()` at create/renew,
unforgeable) equals the on-chain `Site.owner` tag — otherwise an attacker drains the
service WAL extending sites they don't own. Deterministic, NOT an AI; every epoch is a
shared constant or config value.

The on-demand `POST /sites/:id/extend` is a **paid one-off $0.50** (same x402 gate as a
deploy — §4) that runs `extendOnce` after settlement. See `packages/move-subs/SPEC.md`
for the `subscription::renew` terms + the 24h-window anti-back-billing guard.

## 6. Client transport — TWO transports, ONE auth primitive (LOCKED #14, corrected 2026-06-10)

The old "HTTP-only, the WebSocket is dropped" plan in this section was **FALSE against
the running code and was repudiated** — root `CLAUDE.md` LOCKED #14 (corrected
2026-06-10) is the standing architecture:

- **The WS is alive and load-bearing** (`src/ws/index.ts` — `tryUpgrade` /
  `websocketHandler`): it is the wallet's (and Crash's) SOLE transport for `sponsor` +
  `handle`. Auth happens ONCE at upgrade — the client signs a personal-message nonce,
  the recovered address becomes `ws.data.address` (RAM-only session identity), and every
  sponsor call pins `sender` to it (a socket for A can never sponsor for B). The HTTP
  `/sponsor` + `/execute` + `/handle/*` routes were REMOVED when those moved to WS.
  **Verify-failure classification (2026-06-11):** zkLogin verify needs the fullnode, so
  an infra failure there (5xx/timeout/network) is retried (3×, 400 ms) and, if still
  failing, the socket closes `4004 VERIFY_UNAVAILABLE` **without** `connectionRejected`
  — that packet means "permanent, don't reconnect" to the client and is reserved for
  genuine credential failures (one transient fullnode 504 used to brick the wallet
  session until reload). The WS also carries the wallet's subscription `/confirm-subscribe`
  Party-object write (sponsored — §2).
- **The deploy/merchant surface is HTTP by necessity** (agents speak 402-shaped HTTP):
  the deploy itself is authenticated BY THE PAYMENT (the `X-PAYMENT` payload — its
  recovered payer becomes the site owner; nonce-free since 2026-06-14), and the domain
  link/unlink ops use a STATELESS TIMESTAMPED owner-signature (`verifyDeployRequester`
  → `verifyPersonalMessageSignature` → recovered address == `Site.owner`; a client `ts`
  within a freshness window, NO server nonce store — multi-replica-safe).
- **One auth primitive, two transports:** both verify signatures through the same
  recover-and-pin pattern — the verified address is the subject, never a body field;
  per-address rate limiting. The WS signs a connect-nonce ONCE (the socket's identity);
  the HTTP deploy/domain ops carry NO server nonce (payment-authenticated, or a ts-fresh
  signature). Reads go direct-to-chain; nothing is server-pushed beyond the
  sponsor/handle frames.

If a shared `src/auth.ts` helper is ever lifted out (deploy + ws both implement the
pattern today), that is a refactor of duplication, NOT a transport change.

---

## 7. FACILITATOR — BUILT (x402 V2 'exact', KEYLESS + STATELESS)

**The live rail is vanilla x402 V2 'exact' over Sui's protocol-level gasless
Address-Balance transfers.** The payer signs a `send_funds` PTB (`gasPayment=[]`,
`gasPrice=0`) with its OWN key, whose declared outputs ARE the settlement; the
facilitator **verifies** (simulate the signed-but-not-executed tx pays the EXACT
outputs) then **settles** (broadcast over gRPC) — **keyless**: no Enoki, no sponsor, no
owner-tx signing. Source: `src/facilitator/` (`x402.ts` the verify/settle/build core,
`fees.ts` the treasury + fee split, `index.ts` the HTTP layer), on `@suize/x402` (the
gasless builder + `assertOutputsExact` + `recoverPayer` + the gasless-shape guard) and
`@suize/pay` (the merchant middleware). **`account.move` / `RailConfig` / `suize-402/1`
/ `X-Suize-Payment` / `/pay/build` / `/pay/submit` are DELETED — do not resurrect.**

> **The design law: the facilitator is STATELESS + KEYLESS — the CHAIN is the
> database.** Suize stores nothing per payment; the payer carries the signed tx, and
> verification is a simulate + one read. Every trust decision reduces to the on-chain
> balance-change set (the receipt — fee visible). Ground truth stays trust-minimized: a
> merchant can audit the settlement itself via RPC (or `GET /tx`) — the facilitator's
> answer is checkable, not trusted. **The address IS the account** — no API key, no
> signup, no merchant record server-side.

### 7.0 The six endpoints + status (`src/facilitator/index.ts`)

| Endpoint | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /verify` | the verify core — simulate the signed gasless tx pays the EXACT declared outputs; recovered signer == simulated sender (§7.1) | **BUILT + PROVEN** |
| `POST /settle` | broadcast the verified tx over gRPC, await finality, idempotent by digest (§7.1) | **BUILT + PROVEN** |
| `GET /supported` | the x402 V2 capability descriptor: `{ kinds:[{x402Version:2, scheme:'exact', network}], extensions:['payment-identifier'], signers:{'sui:*':[]} }` | **BUILT** |
| `POST /build` | the optional facilitator-built unsigned gasless bytes (THE PROBE RECIPE — the payer signs locally) (§7.1) | **BUILT + PROVEN** |
| `GET /terms?payTo&amount` | the declared `extra.outputs` split EVERY merchant drops into its 402 (NO free tier — unregistered pays the default 2%; 503 if treasury unresolved) (§7.5) | **BUILT** |
| `GET /tx?digest` | a DESCRIPTIVE audit of `balanceChanges` (never trusted, always checkable) | **BUILT** |

The `@suize/pay` middleware (§7.4, `packages/pay`) is the whole merchant integration; an
agent can also pay any merchant's own x402 endpoint directly. The Tier-0 "instant
merchant" screen lives in the wallet's business console (`apps/wallet/SPEC.md`). The E2E
proof inventory + run commands live ONCE in §0.

### 7.1 The verify / settle / build core (x402 V2 'exact' — BUILT + PROVEN)

Deterministic plumbing over ONE gRPC client (the transport where gasless eligibility
resolves) — no Enoki on this path, no database, no sessions. The only server state is
the in-memory settle idempotency cache (§7.5), never payment records. The wire is the
standard x402 V2 `PaymentPayload` + `PaymentRequirements` pair; amounts are decimal USDC
strings on the public surface, atomic-unit strings inside `extra.outputs`.

- **`POST /verify`** `{ paymentPayload, paymentRequirements }` →
  `200 VerifyResponse { isValid: true, payer }` | `{ isValid: false, invalidReason, invalidMessage }`.
  Read-only (simulate + one tx-state read — NEVER broadcasts). Asserts `scheme === 'exact'` ∧
  `network` match ∧ the payload is `{ signature, transaction }` (base64), then in
  parallel **recovers the signer** (`recoverPayer`) and **simulates** the tx to prove
  it credits the declared outputs EXACTLY (`assertOutputsExact` — the protocol DEFAULT
  for empty `extra.outputs` is a single full-amount leg to `payTo`, but a Suize merchant
  always declares the `[merchant net, treasury fee]` split from /terms — NO free tier).
  Three more hard guards: a
  cheap **gasless-shape check** (`assertGaslessTxShape` — `gasPrice 0`, `gasPayment`
  empty, only the allowlisted `send_funds`/`redeem_funds`/`coin::into_balance` + coin
  split/merge commands, no arbitrary command routes the asset), **recovered signer
  == simulated sender** (no proxy debits), and a **replay guard**: the digest is computed
  from the signed bytes and ONE `getTransaction` read rejects an **already-executed**
  payment (`invalid_exact_sui_payload_already_executed`). Simulation alone is NOT a
  replay guard — a gasless Address-Balance tx has no object inputs, so re-simulating a
  *settled* tx still SUCCEEDS (proven on testnet 2026-06-12); the chain read is the only
  sound guard, and a replayed payload would otherwise pass `/verify` for its whole
  ValidDuring window and double-serve a merchant. A definitive mismatch is a `200`
  `isValid:false` with the x402 `invalidReason`; only a malformed body is a `400`.
- **`POST /settle`** `{ paymentPayload, paymentRequirements }` →
  `200 SettleResponse { success, transaction:<digest>, network, payer, amount }`.
  **Idempotent by digest, chain-read-first** — the digest is precomputed from the bytes
  (`Transaction.from().getDigest()`); a per-replica terminal cache + in-flight join
  fast-paths a local replay, and the run-closure then **reads the chain for an
  already-executed digest** and returns its on-chain result directly — WITHOUT re-verify
  (which now rejects an already-executed digest as a replay) and WITHOUT re-broadcast
  (gRPC `executeTransaction` THROWS on a spent tx). Otherwise it **re-verifies** (never
  broadcasts an unverified tx), then `executeTransaction` over gRPC + `waitForTransaction`
  (finality on the OWN client so an immediate read is answerable) + the effects check: a
  tx that executed but **FAILED on-chain → `success:false`** (a failed tx never reads as
  settled). A retry is never a double charge. A settle failure is a `200` `success:false`
  (the protocol carries the reason); only a malformed request is a `4xx`.
- **`POST /build`** `{ sender, outputs? | requirements? }` → `200 { bytes }`. The
  optional facilitator-built **unsigned gasless** bytes (THE PROBE RECIPE:
  `buildGaslessOutputs` sets `gasBudget(0n)` to force the gasless election). Either
  explicit atomic-unit `outputs` (1..8 legs, each a `0x` address + positive amount) OR a
  `{ payTo, amount }` `requirements` shape from which the fee policy derives the split.
  Belt-and-braces: the facilitator runs `assertUnsignedBytesSafe` on the bytes it built
  (the same hard pre-sign gate the payer must run) before handing them back — it never
  hands back unsafe bytes. The payer signs these **LOCALLY** (the facilitator never signs
  an owner leg). `503` only when a split is DERIVED from `requirements` and the treasury
  is unresolved (a build given EXPLICIT `outputs` needs no treasury and always works).

> **PROVEN on-chain (E2E, real testnet):** the payer signs a gasless `send_funds`,
> pays **ZERO gas** (protocol-level rebate — no gas token, ever), and the exact declared
> outputs (merchant net + the treasury fee leg) land atomically. The facilitator holds
> no key; it only simulated + broadcast.

### 7.2 The 402 challenge — the x402 V2 `PaymentRequired` body (the standard wire)

The merchant answers HTTP **402** with the standard x402 V2 `PaymentRequired` body (plus
the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header), minted by `@suize/pay`'s `mintPaymentRequired`. It is the
vanilla x402 shape — the `accepts[]` array of `PaymentRequirements`, each naming the
scheme/network/asset/payTo/amount, the fee split in `extra.outputs`, and an `extra.buildUrl`
pointing at the facilitator's `POST /build`. Defined HERE so the `@suize/pay` middleware
(§7.4), the MCP's `suize_pay` (§3), and the PAY wallet all agree on one shape:

```json
{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "error": "payment required",
  "accepts": [
    {
      "scheme": "exact",
      "network": "sui:testnet",
      "asset": "0x…::usdc::USDC",
      "payTo": "0x<merchant address>",
      "amount": "0.50",
      "maxTimeoutSeconds": 120,
      "extra": {
        "outputs": [
          { "to": "0x<merchant address>", "amount": "490000" },
          { "to": "0x<treasury address>", "amount": "10000" }
        ],
        "buildUrl": "https://api.suize.io/build"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Wire laws: the public `amount` is a **decimal USDC string** (`"0.50"`); the
`extra.outputs` legs are **atomic-unit strings** (the exact balance-change set the
facilitator enforces — `490000` net + `10000` fee = the full `500000`, **merchant-
absorbed**, so the payer is debited exactly `0.50`). A **single output** (no `extra.outputs`,
or one full-amount leg to `payTo`) is the protocol DEFAULT — but Suize's /terms always
declares the split, so there is **NO free tier** (every merchant pays; the only
single-output case is structural — merchant == treasury). `network` names the
chain (`sui:mainnet` / `sui:testnet`). **The PAYER never speaks base units on the public
surface** — it either echoes the merchant's `accepts[0]` to `POST /build` or builds the
`send_funds` PTB from the declared `outputs`, signs locally, and presents the b64
`PaymentPayload` in the **`X-PAYMENT`** header on retry. The fee split is the merchant's
declared terms; the payer-built or facilitator-built tx must credit them EXACTLY or
`/verify` rejects it. The `payment-identifier` extension (advertised by `/supported`)
carries an optional correlation id for the agents that want one — it is NOT load-bearing
for settlement (the digest is the proof).

### 7.3 The hosted pay page — RETIRED 2026-06-15

The hosted pay page (`pay.suize.io` / `apps/pay`), the `POST /checkout` URL formatter,
the `PAY_PAGE`/`PAY_PAGE_URL` env, the SSO-bridge `/bridge` iframe + `/confirm` money
popup, and the human-pays / pay-link door are **DELETED.** Every CHARGE merchant and
Deploy are paid by the AGENT signing the gasless USDC payment ITSELF and presenting
`X-PAYMENT` (its own Sui key, or its zkLogin session via `@suize/mcp`) — there is no
human-relay surface. Merchant integration = the `@suize/pay` middleware (§7.4), or the
agent pays the merchant's own x402 endpoint directly.

Still true and unchanged: **Webhooks are DELETED from v1** — settlement notice is the
merchant's own `/verify` (on-retry via the middleware, or polling); ground truth never
moves off the on-chain receipt. (Stripe phrasing law: Suize **COEXISTS** with Stripe —
"keep Stripe for humans, add Suize for agents" — never claim integration INTO Stripe.)

### 7.4 The `@suize/pay` middleware (BUILT: `packages/pay`) — the whole merchant integration, one import

The x402 V2 snippet as a package (**zero runtime deps**), configured with the merchant's
OWN terms. **API:** `suize({ to, price, facilitator?, network? })` returns the fetch-style
wrapper `paywall(handler)` (Bun.serve / Hono / Next route handlers), with `paywall.express`
attached (structural Express types — no `@types/express` dependency) for custom transports;
malformed config throws at boot, never mints unverifiable challenges. It does exactly two
things:

1. Request without valid payment → answer **402** with the x402 V2 `PaymentRequired` body
   (§7.2, `mintPaymentRequired`) + the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header. The declared
   `extra.outputs` come from the merchant's own terms (`/terms` resolves the 2%/1¢ split
   for EVERY merchant — no free tier; only a first-party merchant == treasury collapses to one leg).
2. Request carrying the b64 `PaymentPayload` in the **`X-PAYMENT`** header → parse it →
   call the facilitator `POST /verify` + `POST /settle` against the merchant's OWN
   configured terms → serve ONLY when both succeed (the settled tx pays the EXACT
   declared outputs) AND the digest is unseen.

**The state is one in-memory structure:** the **seen-digest `Set`** (one digest = one
serve — the replay guard; the on-chain idempotent settle is the durable guard, the chain
rejects a re-broadcast). The restart caveat: a restart resets the replay guard, and the
settle's own digest cache + the chain's re-broadcast rejection bound the exposure — persist
the set if one payment guarding many serves matters to you.

**Fail-closed LAW (every facilitator consumer):** a never-settled / unreadable digest is
NOT a definitive paid. A consumer MUST treat anything that isn't a verified+settled
success as unpaid — the middleware does (any non-success, including a fetch failure → a
fresh 402).

That is the ENTIRE merchant surface: no keys, no signup, no webhook handler, no chain
code. The merchant is the verifier of its own terms; Suize is plumbing.
*(npm note: the package is currently `"private": true` with TS-source exports — an npm
publish later needs a build step.)*

### 7.5 Minimal abuse guards (the ONLY guards in v1)

- **The verify spine** — every trust decision reduces to the §7.1 verify/settle
  assertions over the on-chain balance-change set; nothing else is trusted, nothing
  else is stored.
- **TWO per-IP token buckets by cost** (the facilitator's OWN — `src/facilitator/index.ts`),
  **both FAIL CLOSED on a null IP**: a **WRITE bucket** (`/settle` + `/build`
  — capacity 6, refill 0.5/s; each token is a broadcast/build) and a separate,
  **looser READ bucket** (`/verify` + `/terms` + `/tx` + `/supported` — capacity 30,
  refill 5/s; cheap simulate/reads so legit polling never trips). Validation precedes
  the bucket — a malformed request never burns a token.
- **`/settle`** — idempotent by digest (§7.1's terminal cache + in-flight join +
  chain-readability fallback): retries are free, double charges impossible. No sponsor
  ceiling applies — the facilitator is keyless, the payer pays zero gas at the protocol
  level, so there is no Enoki budget to grind.
- **The exact-outputs check is the fee guard** — a single-output payment to a fee-tier
  merchant fails `assertOutputsExact` (the treasury leg is missing) → not verified, not
  settled. The fee can't be routed around.
- **Treasury fail-closed** — `/terms`/`/build` REFUSES (503) when the
  SuiNS-resolved treasury is unknown (a fee with an unknown recipient would burn the rake
  or pay a squatter); free-tier (single-output) verify/settle/build never touch it.
- **The multi-replica landmine** — the settle idempotency cache is per-replica in-memory:
  running more than one replica needs sticky routing or shared state (flagged; v1 runs
  one). The on-chain idempotent settle is the durable backstop.

### 7.6 Merchant on-ramps — the ladder (amended 2026-06-10)

Every tier lands on the SAME rail + receipt — the tiers only change WHO WRITES THE
402:

- **TIER 0 — INSTANT MERCHANT (a screen, not an API — lives in the WALLET's
  business console, owner 2026-06-11).** Sign in with Google (zkLogin mints your
  `payTo` address) and the console hands you a **READ-ONLY on-chain payment
  history** (the receipt events for that address, read straight from chain — no
  database, no merchant record server-side). Zero code, zero keys; vanilla x402
  pays any plain address, so *"your address is your account"* is literally true.
- **TIER 3 — THE 402 MIDDLEWARE** (`@suize/pay`, §7.4) — for merchants who own
  their HTTP surface and serve agents directly. The agent pays it (or any merchant's
  own x402 endpoint) by signing the gasless payment itself and presenting `X-PAYMENT`.
- **TIER 4 — PLATFORM GATEWAY PLUGINS (ROADMAP).** Gateway plugins for hosted
  commerce platforms, configured with the merchant's `payTo`. Per the standards-only
  law (root `CLAUDE.md`): **NO platform names in public copy until a plugin ships** —
  internal note only: WooCommerce/Wix/BigCommerce are the open-gateway candidates;
  Shopify is gated (crypto-app program + rev-share).

Anti-abuse everywhere = IP/volume rate limits (§7.5), never identity. The merchant
copy law (lead with the fee delta, agents-first) lives in root `CLAUDE.md` —
referenced, not redeclared.

### 7.7 Protocol positioning + the claim ladder (the binding copy law)

- **The protocol IS x402 V2 'exact'** (§7.2) — the standard wire, the merged Sui exact
  scheme; the facilitator implements it natively, no proprietary fork.
- **The claim ladder (binding — write at the rung true ON PUBLISH, ~June 18, when the
  upstream PRs are OPEN but not merged):** ALLOWED — *"gasless"* (literally true,
  protocol-level), *"x402-compatible by design,"* *"implements the merged x402 Sui exact
  scheme,"* *"we run a live x402 facilitator for Sui,"* *"the x402 Sui implementation,
  contributed upstream (PR open)."* FORBIDDEN until the mechanism PR MERGES — *"on x402,"
  "official x402 facilitator," "listed by x402," "the default Sui facilitator"* as fact
  (may be stated as an ambition). The land-grab thesis (no dominant Sui facilitator) is
  the motivation, NOT a present-tense claim.
- **The other discovery doors:** **`llms.txt`** — the static door advertising the rail
  to non-MCP agents (LIVE at `suize.io/llms.txt`; content LAW in root `CLAUDE.md`) — and
  **OpenAPI** — the deploy/merchant HTTP surfaces (§4) double as the OpenAPI door (not
  yet published as a spec document).

---

### 7.8 directory — the agent-commerce surface for `agents.suize.io` (BUILT 2026-06-14)

`src/directory/`. The read + ad-slot surface behind the directory app (`apps/agents/SPEC.md`).
**Merchant-agnostic + stateless:** every Suize x402 payment carries a fee leg to the
treasury (the fee is per-merchant variable but **never waived** — always ≥ the $0.01
floor), so a single `queryTransactionBlocks({ ToAddress: treasury })` enumerates EVERY
payment with zero per-merchant config. Treasury resolves LIVE from `treasury@suize`
(cached ≤1h, fail-closed). The per-tx parse keys on a **positive** treasury USDC leg
(treasury *received*); payer = the most-negative leg, merchant = the largest positive
non-treasury leg (or treasury itself for a full-to-treasury deploy charge); `fee` is read
from the actual treasury leg, `feeBps = round(fee/gross·10⁴)` — **never assumed 2%**. All
endpoints are read-through cached (feed ~8s, rankings ~30s); the chain stays the database.

| Endpoint | Shape |
|---|---|
| `GET /feed?limit=` | `{ payments:[{ digest, payer, payerHandle, merchant, merchantHandle, gross, fee, feeBps, timestampMs }] }` — newest x402 payments; handles reverse-resolved (cached, resilient). |
| `GET /rankings?limit=` | `{ merchants:[{ merchant, handle, volume, count }] }` — per-merchant volume, desc (≈400-tx scan). |
| `GET /stats` · `POST /stats/visit` | `{ visitorsToday }` — in-memory UTC-day counter (no DB; client dedupes per session). |
| `GET /ads/slots` | `{ slots:[{ key,label,blurb,slotId,price,holder,holderHandle,creative,lastBidMs,minNextBid }], cheapest }` — each `AdSlot` read on-chain. |
| `GET /ads/slots/:key` | `{ slot, bid:{ target, configObject, slotObject, coinType, minNextBid } }` (200); a **402** x402 challenge when `?x402=1` + `Accept: application/json`; 404 unknown key. The bid settles via the sponsored `auction::bid` Move call (`packages/move-auction`) — the route is the discovery/challenge front. |
| `GET /directory.json` · `/directory.okf` | the merchant-agnostic catalog (JSON + an OKF markdown bundle) for agents — the "we speak Google's OKF" flag. |

The ad-slot auction is a Suize-onboarded product on its own rail: each bid's net → the
directory (`DIRECTORY_PAYTO`), the fee → treasury, so ad sales appear in `/feed` (dogfood).
`AUCTION_MOVE_TARGETS` is unioned into the sponsor allow-list (§2). Reproducible
post-publish config: `scripts/sync-auction-config.ts` (mirrors `sync-subs-config.ts`).

---

## 8. Readiness + boot (BUILT)

`src/index.ts`. Boot fails fast if `ENOKI_PRIVATE_API_KEY` is missing. Warns if
`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is empty (browser origins gate CORS + — today — the WS upgrade).

> **DEPLOY-CHECKLIST — `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` REPLACES the defaults.** When the env var
> is set it OVERRIDES `DEFAULT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` wholesale (`src/config.ts` ~L50 —
> it is `fromEnv.length > 0 ? fromEnv : defaults`, never a union). So the prod/k8s

| Probe | Gates |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | liveness (`ok`) |
| `GET /ready` | all CONFIGURED components up (200) — an unconfigured handle/deploy is omitted, never a 503 |
| `GET /ready/sponsor` | sponsor Sui RPC reachable |
| `GET /ready/handle` | handle module (SuiNS config + RPC); 503 when unconfigured |
| `GET /ready/deploy` | deploy wallet configured + Sui RPC; 503 when unset |
| `GET /ready/ws` | WS plumbing (the live sponsor/handle transport — LOCKED #14) |
| `GET /ready/serve` | the k8s readinessProbe target — request-serving surfaces only (sponsor + WS); EXCLUDES handle so a SuiNS blip can't pull the rail out of rotation |

`idleTimeout: 200s` — a deploy is a ~20s synchronous surface (two Walrus PUTs + the Site
mint) with no bytes flowing; Bun's default 10s would 502 it mid-deploy.

---

## 9. The number wall + key separation (LAW)

- **The deterministic core owns every on-chain amount/fee/size.** No LLM, no signal ever
  emits a number that lands in a transaction. The fee split is the facilitator's declared
  `extra.outputs` (the 2%/1¢ math in `fees.ts`); the storage extender passes only the
  clamped epoch count; the on-chain terms supply each subscription period's amount.
- **The backend never signs an owner tx.** It signs only: sponsored gas (Enoki private
  key), the deploy `Site` mints (deploy service wallet), and SuiNS leaf mints (handle
  issuer key). Three SEPARATE secrets — never reuse one across modules. The Enoki sponsor
  key and any future scoped key live in env (SOPS in k8s); production keys belong in
  KMS/HSM (mainnet gate).
- **Custody:** *"fully non-custodial — your keys never leave your machine."* The honest
  caveat (delegated-spend, not custody risk) lives in the root `CLAUDE.md` — referenced,
  not redeclared.

## 10. Conventions

ESM + Bun runtime. One process, one port (default 8080), one image. `src/config.ts` is
the sole env boundary (mirrored by `.env.example`). Network, on-chain ids, version pins,
and the move-call allow-list lists live ONLY in `@suize/shared`.

---

## 11. Ops — build, secrets, run (the production runbook facts)

- **Image:** built from the **repo root** context (workspace dep on `@suize/shared`) via
  `services/backend/Dockerfile`; `bun run push` (or `push:patch|minor|major`) builds
  linux/amd64 + pushes to the container registry configured via env (`DOCKER_REGISTRY` /
  `DOCKER_IMAGE`). `bun run typecheck` must be clean first.
- **Secrets — env-only, never committed (one Opaque Secret via `envFrom` in the deploy
  environment):** `ENOKI_PRIVATE_API_KEY` (sponsor), `DEPLOY_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` (deploy
  service wallet — its OWN key, pays its own gas), `HANDLE_ISSUER_PRIVATE_KEY` +
  `SUINS_PARENT_NFT_ID` (handle, optional), `CF_API_TOKEN` (CF-for-SaaS custom hostnames,
  optional), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `MEMWAL_MASTER_KEY` (brain + memory, optional).
  **Separate keys per module — never reuse.** Full name list: `services/backend/.env.example`.
- **Run:** one container, one port (`PORT`, default 8080), reached through the public host
  `api.suize.io` (`facilitator.suize.io` is an alias). `GET /ws` (sponsor/execute + handle),
  `POST /mcp`, the `/deploy*` + `/domains*` + `/execute` HTTP surfaces, the facilitator
  (`/verify` `/settle` `/supported` `/build` `/terms` `/tx` — §7), and the health/readiness
  routes all live behind it — no separate sponsor host.
- **Verify after deploy:** `curl /health` → `ok`; `/ready` reports per-component;
  `/ready/serve` is the readinessProbe target (§8).
- **Client wire contracts** live in `@suize/shared` — never restated in a runbook.

### Open question for the owner — none

The old `account.move` allow-list question is **MOOT**: the rail moved to vanilla x402
V2 (a gasless `send_funds` needs no sponsor allow-list at all — the facilitator is
keyless), and the sponsor allow-list is now `[...CRASH, ...(SUBS_PUBLISHED ? SUBS : []),
...(AUCTION_PUBLISHED ? AUCTION : []), ...MEMWAL]` (§2 — `WALLET` removed 2026-06-14). (The
old §6 HTTP-only-refactor question stays CLOSED — LOCKED #14 keeps the WS.)
